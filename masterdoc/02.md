# Capture results of AutoML experiments on the dataset and persist to Data Lake for reporting and analysis.

## Run an AutoML job:
Here, we will run an AutoML job in Azure Machine Learning workspace.

1. Launch Azure Machine Learning Workspace:
    - Navigate to the resoruce group where all resources are present and click on **Azure Machine Learning Workspace name**:

3. Create an AutoML run by navigating to **"Automated ML > + New Automated ML job"**:

    - [Navigate Auto ML](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/Azure-Synapse-Solution-Accelerator-Financial-Analytics-Customer-Revenue-Growth-Factor/blob/main/images/24.png?raw=true)
    
    - Under **Select data asset**, select your dataset from below, and click on **Next**:
    
    - [Select data asset](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/Azure-Synapse-Solution-Accelerator-Financial-Analytics-Customer-Revenue-Growth-Factor/blob/main/images/25.png?raw=true)
    
    - Under **Configure job**, make sure to provide the following details, and click on **Next**:
      
       Experiment type: Create new
       Experiment name: **customergrowthfactors**
       Target column: Select **growth(Integer)**
       Select compute type: Select **Compute cluster**
